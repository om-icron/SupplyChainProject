# SupplyChainv0-gym
Reinforcement Learning for Optimal inventory policy
Environments for Supply chain

This library contains environments consisting of operations research problems which adhere to the OpenAI Gym API. The purpose is to bring reinforcement learning to the operations research community via accessible simulation environments featuring classic problems that are solved both with reinforcement learning as well as traditional OR techniques.

This library requires Python 3.5+ in order to function.

For the RL algorithms, Ray 1.0.0 is required.
